# What is sat？
"Sats" is a colloquial abbreviation for "satoshi," the smallest unit of Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million smaller units, with each unit being called one satoshi. In the early days of Bitcoin, when the value of 1 Bitcoin (BTC) was relatively low, satoshis were seldom used or mentioned. However, as the value of Bitcoin has increased, satoshis have become more significant as a unit of transaction and pricing.
